        <h1>Game Description: Collect the Coins</h1>
        <p>"Collect the Coins" is an engaging and interactive web-based game designed to test players' reflexes and coordination. The objective of the game is straightforward: guide a blue block around the game canvas to collect as many golden coins as possible within a limited timeframe.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay Mechanics:</h2>
        <p><strong>Game Area:</strong> The game is played on an 800x600 pixel canvas with a white background, bordered by a black line, ensuring clear visibility of the player's movement and objectives.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Player Control:</strong> Players control the blue block using the arrow keys on their keyboard. Movement is smooth as players can navigate the block in four directions: up, down, left, and right.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Coins:</strong> The primary objective is to collect golden coins that randomly spawn on the canvas. Players start the game with five coins already in play, and additional coins appear each time one is collected.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Scoring:</strong> Each time a coin is collected, the player's score increases by one. The game features a winning condition where collecting 20 coins results in a victory.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Timer:</strong> Players race against the clock with a countdown timer set at 59 seconds. Players must collect coins before time runs out to avoid losing the game.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Levels and Progression:</strong> While the current version maintains a single level, the foundation is set for a future implementation of progressive levels if desired.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Game Over Conditions:</strong> The game ends when the player either collects 20 coins, triggering a winning message, or when the timer reaches zero, resulting in a game-over state. In either case, players receive feedback on their performance.</p>

        <h2>User Interface:</h2>
        <p>The game features a clean, intuitive interface that displays the current score, level, and remaining time, helping players keep track of their performance at a glance.</p>
        
        <p>Upon completion of a game (win or lose), the player is presented with a message and given an option to restart the game with the click of a button.</p>

        <h2>Visual and Functional Design:</h2>
        <p>The game's visual style is minimalistic yet vibrant, focusing user attention on the block and coins against a stark background.</p>
        
        <p>Responsive and efficient controls ensure that the game is easy to pick up while providing a satisfying challenge.</p>
